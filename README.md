# Unreal Engine Advanced Course - Mastering Unreal Techniques

## Overview
Welcome to the **Unreal Engine Advanced Course** repository! This repository contains all the materials, code, and resources for the advanced Unreal Engine training. The course is designed for developers with experience in Unreal Engine, C++, and Blueprints, and it focuses on enhancing your skills in modular gameplay, systems integration, and advanced Unreal features.

This repository will guide you through the course's phases, covering everything from strengthening your C++ and Blueprint knowledge to mastering the **Gameplay Ability System (G.A.S.)**, and UI development using **Common UI Plugin**. 

## Course Outline

### **Phase 1: Strengthening C++ and Blueprint Fundamentals**
- **C++ in Unreal Engine**:
  - Learn coding conventions (UCLASS, UPROPERTY, UFUNCTION).
  - Work with essential classes like `AActor`, `UObject`, `UComponent`.
  - Integrating logic between C++ and Blueprints.
  
- **Advanced Blueprint Techniques**:
  - Build modular gameplay using Blueprints with interfaces and components.
  - Use event dispatchers and delegates for clean, modular code.
  
- **Design Patterns in Unreal**:
  - Implement design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer) within Unreal Engine.

### **Phase 2: Introduction to Gameplay Ability System (G.A.S.)**
- **G.A.S. Fundamentals**:
  - Learn the architecture of G.A.S. (AbilitySystemComponent, Attributes, and GameplayAbilities).
  
- **Advanced G.A.S. Techniques**:
  - Dive into GameplayTags and their use in abilities.
  - Master GameplayEffects and how they interact with the characterâ€™s state in real-time.

### **Phase 3: Gemfeatures Plugin and Data Assets**
- **Modular Development with Gemfeatures Plugin**:
  - Learn to create and manage modular features like inventory or combat systems.

- **Using Data Assets**:
  - Manage static data with Data Assets and Data Tables for scalable game systems.

### **Phase 4: UI Development with Common UI Plugin**
- **Building Modular UIs**:
  - Learn to use Common UI Plugin for reusable UI widgets.
  - Create multiplayer-friendly UIs responsive to game states.

- **UI & G.A.S. Integration**:
  - Display ability cooldowns, effects, and feedback in UI components.

### **Phase 5: Complete Project**
- Build a small game prototype or system using G.A.S., Common UI, and Data Assets.
- Optimize code and Blueprints for performance across platforms.
- Finalize your project by testing on multiple devices and optimizing the server if needed.
